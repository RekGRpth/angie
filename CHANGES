    *) Security: added extra limitations to HTTP/2 stream handling for
       better protection against the DoS attack known as "HTTP/2 Rapid
       Reset" (CVE-2023-44487).


Changes with Angie 1.3.0                                         19 Sep 2023

    *) Feature: ability to specify multiple match patterns in the "location"
       directive, which allows to combine several "location" blocks with
       similar settings and therefore simplify configuration by reducing
       duplication.

    *) Feature: export of varied statistics metrics in Prometheus format
       with flexible template configuration using the new "prometheus" and
       "prometheus_template" directives.

    *) Feature: detailed information and metrics for groups of stream
       upstream servers in the statistics interface provided by the "api"
       directive.

    *) Feature: the "resolve" option of the "server" directive in the
       "stream" module’s "upstream" block that allows to monitor changes to
       the list of IP addresses corresponding to a domain name, and
       automatically update it without the need of reloading configuration.

    *) Feature: the "service" option of the "server" directive in the
       "stream" module’s "upstream" block that allows to retrieve lists of
       addresses from DNS SRV records, with basic priority support.

    *) Feature: access to the contents of configuration files used by the
       current generation of worker processes via the interface provided by
       the "api" directive with the "api_config_files" directive enabled.

    *) Feature: display of the configuration generation number in process
       titles, which allows to monitor the success of configuration reloads
       and the number of previous worker process generations using the "ps"
       utility.

    *) Feature: all functionality of nginx 1.25.2.

    *) Bugfix: compilation failed when ./configure options
       "--without-http_upstream_zone_module" or
       "--without-stream_upstream_zone_module" were used; the bug had
       appeared in 1.2.0.

    *) Change: now appname "angie" is used when loading the OpenSSL
       configuration.


Changes with Angie 1.2.0                                         30 May 2023

    *) Feature: the "sticky" directive and related options in the HTTP
       module "upstream" block, that allow to configure sticky sessions
       mode, where all requests of the session are routed to the same
       server.

    *) Feature: the $upstream_sticky_status variable, that takes either
       "NEW", "HIT" or "MISS" values depending on success of requesting
       related upstream server with sticky sessions enabled.

    *) Feature: support for NTLS in the HTTP and stream modules using
       TongSuo TLS library, that can be enabled via the "--with-ntls" build
       time option and configured with the "ssl_ntls" and "proxy_ssl_ntls"
       corresponding directives.

    *) Feature: in the HTTP and stream proxy-modules ability to specify
       multiple certificates with different types (RSA and ECDSA) and
       corresponding keys, using the "proxy_ssl_certificate" and
       "proxy_ssl_certificate_key" directives.

    *) Feature: display of version and build name in the "master" process
       title, which allows to get this information about a running server
       instance using the "ps" utility.

    *) Feature: ability to compress of "207 Multi-Status" responses by the
       gzip module. Thanks to DBotThePony.

    *) Feature: all functionality of nginx 1.25.0, including HTTP/3 support.

    *) Feature: the "resolve" option of the "server" directive in the HTTP
       module "upstream" block, that allows to monitor changes to the list
       of IP addresses corresponding to a domain name, and automatically

    *) Feature: the "service" option of the "server" directive in the HTTP
       module "upstream" block, that allows to retrieve lists of addresses
       from DNS SRV records, with basic priority support.

    *) Feature: detailed information and metrics for the groups of HTTP
       upstream servers in the statistics interface provided by the "api"
       directive.

    *) Feature: autoindex uses natural sorting order for directory listings.

    *) Feature: all functionality of nginx 1.23.3.

    *) Bugfix: compilation failed due to false warning when using GCC 9 or
       older with the -O2 or higher optimization.


Changes with Angie 1.0.0                                         27 Oct 2022

    *) Feature: the "api" directive, that provides HTTP RESTful interface
       for accessing in JSON format basic information about a web server
       instance, as well as metrics of client connections, shared memory
       zones, DNS queries, HTTP requests, HTTP responses cache, TCP/UDP
       sessions of "stream" module, and zones of "limit_conn/limit_req"
       modules.

    *) Feature: the "status_zone" directive in "http" module for specifying
       zone to collect request metrics in "server" and "location" contexts.

    *) Feature: the "status_zone" directive in "stream" module for
       specifying zone to collect TCP/UDP session metrics.

    *) Feature: the "status_zone" parameter of the "resolver" directive for
       specifying zone to collect metrics on DNS queries.

    *) Feature: the $angie_version variable with version of Angie.

    *) Feature: all functionality of nginx 1.23.2.
